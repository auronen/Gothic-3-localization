His work was not yet done and he was speaking about a better life!\nLeft on our own now we were waiting for a fighter who could direct us onto the right path:\n to finish grandfather's work.

Suffering and desperation clouded the view and still we were on the hunt for him.\nWe solved problems here and for thanks we got new ones there, more impressive tasks.\nHeavy was the weight on our shoulders. Too heavy for some of us. And so we lost a few of our brothers right from the start of our hunt.\nNo, not that I doubted our goal, but had the first of the sacrifices to be brought right now already?",

Still, we don't have to face the oncoming signs and dangers alone anymore. On our way we found noble knights, who wandered with us on the same path. With their aid we could in shorter time battle a larger number of dangers.\n\nWithout doubt: without our new companions, at this moment, we would not have been this far along the path.",
