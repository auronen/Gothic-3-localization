	"SVM_Hum_Old_Wise_Teach_Smith_2_02":"Heat the blank, work it, cool it.",
	"SVM_Hum_Old_Wise_Teach_Smith_2_03":"But of course, a magic ore weapon needs a magic ore blank.",
	"SVM_Hum_Old_Wise_Teach_Sneak_2_00":"This is quite different from sneaking up on people!",
	"SVM_Hum_Old_Wise_Teach_Sneak_2_01":"Stalking is the only way to get within reach of a wild animal.",
	"SVM_Hum_Old_Wise_Teach_Sneak_2_02":"Always creep up from behind - and don't think that the animal won't be able to scent you!",
	"SVM_Hum_Old_Wise_Teach_Sneak_2_03":"If you get too close, it's over. So the best weapon for hunting is the bow.",
	"SVM_Hum_Old_Wise_Teach_Sprinter_00":"Breathing is the most important thing. If you breathe wrong, you will soon be winded.",
