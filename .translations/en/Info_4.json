	"INFO_FILLER314":"Deckard the quartermaster is pleased with the potions. Well done.",
	"INFO_FILLER315":"The alchemist is very happy with you. Not bad.",
	"INFO_FILLER316":"You brought back Urkrass's delivery.",
	"INFO_FILLER317":"Gamal's slave is back... he has nothing but good things to say about you.",
	"INFO_FILLER318":"Jens the hunter says you're useful.",
	"INFO_FILLER325":"Don't even think about it.",
	"INFO_FILLER326":"Huh? What are you talking about?",
	"INFO_FILLER327":"This chest belongs to Gamal.",
	"INFO_FILLER328":"Touch it and I'll chop off your hand!",
	"INFO_FILLER330":"Hands off that chest!",
	"INFO_FILLER333":"What is special about the artifacts?",
	"INFO_FILLER346":"Seek out Xardas and find out what he has the orcs digging for.",
	"INFO_FILLER347":"They are looking for something they do not understand. Only Xardas understands it.",
	"INFO_FILLER348":"Tell me - what are they seeking?",
	"INFO_FILLER349":"What dark secret does Xardas believe he knows? What ancient power does he hope to find?",
	"INFO_FILLER351":"I have fought many battles. And survived every opponent.",
	"INFO_FILLER352":"Yes, but now it's time to surrender.",
	"INFO_FILLER353":"This battle will decide the future of the world!",
	"INFO_FILLER358":"Do you believe that you are a match for me?",
	"INFO_FILLER359":"Let's find out.",
	"INFO_FILLER369":"Welcome, redeemer. Word of your deeds has raced ahead of you.",
	"INFO_FILLER370":"Why redeemer?",
	"INFO_FILLER371":"Innos himself spoke to me. He said that a ship would bring our salvation.",
	"INFO_FILLER372":"I sent the Esmeralda, and she brought you.",
	"INFO_FILLER373":"It was your orders that put me behind the barrier in the first place!",
	"INFO_FILLER374":"... and thus you could find out who you truly are.",
	"INFO_FILLER375":"It was you who defeated the Sleeper and the dragons of Khorinis!",
	"INFO_FILLER376":"My guards merely gave you a push in the right direction.",
	"INFO_FILLER377":"Continue.",
	"INFO_FILLER378":"No doubt you have already accomplished great deeds.",
	"INFO_FILLER379":"But if we want to win this war, you will have to accomplish even more. Much more.",
	"INFO_FILLER380":"I charge you with an important mission.",
	"INFO_FILLER381":"What sort of mission?",
	"INFO_FILLER382":"The orcs have only won this war because they have allied themselves with Xardas.",
	"INFO_FILLER383":"He has used his dark power and rendered our holy runes ineffective!",
	"INFO_FILLER384":"Now he has ordered excavations in the desert. He is looking for something.",
	"INFO_FILLER385":"I want you to seek out Xardas. Find out what his plans are.",
	"INFO_FILLER387":"What do you know about the artifacts?",
	"INFO_FILLER391":"I'll offer you a deal...",
	"INFO_FILLER392":"Do you perhaps wish to beg for your life?",
	"INFO_FILLER393":"Give me the scepter, and I'll grant you a quick death.",
	"INFO_FILLER394":"... You madman. You will never leave this place alive.",
	"INFO_FILLER395":"Let's get it over with.",
	"INFO_FILLER408":"To free the world from the war of the gods.",
	"INFO_FILLER409":"You have betrayed our people. YOUR people.",
	"INFO_FILLER410":"The war of the gods cannot end as long as the divine power remains in this world.",
	"INFO_FILLER411":"You have destroyed our hopes. The human people are doomed to destruction.",
	"INFO_FILLER412":"No. They too will find peace. A peace they never would have had under the rule of Innos.",
	"INFO_FILLER413":"You have destroyed the artifacts, but there is still divine power in this world. I carry the power of Innos within me.",
	"INFO_FILLER414":"It is time to give back that power.",
	"INFO_FILLER415":"Yes. As you say... it is time. Now see how a king fights.",
	"INFO_FILLER418":"It is said that Innos grants his power to the bearer of the divine artifacts.",
	"INFO_FILLER419":"Who are you?",
	"INFO_FILLER420":"I am Marlo. I'm the best merchant on the coast, from Ardea all the way to Cape Dun.",
	"INFO_FILLER421":"What interests me most are valuable items.",
	"INFO_FILLER425":"Where can I find trade goods here on the coast?",
	"INFO_FILLER426":"I can give you some information, but not for free.",
	"INFO_FILLER431":"What can I find in Cape Dun?",
	"INFO_FILLER435":"That fat alchemist in Cape Dun has a chest where he stores his stuff.",
	"INFO_FILLER436":"The orcs pay him with the booty from their campaign. There ought to be some good stuff to be had there.",
	"INFO_FILLER437":"Maybe later.",
	"INFO_FILLER439":"I think so. I can show you how to reach into other people's pockets and things like that.",
	"INFO_FILLER440":"But you have to earn it first. Defeat me in a fight, and I will be your teacher.",
	"INFO_FILLER442":"What have you done? The orcs would have let us live!",
	"INFO_FILLER443":"Now Xardas will send even more of them after us!",
	"INFO_FILLER447":"What has Xardas got to do with the orcs?",
	"INFO_FILLER448":"What's wrong with you? Haven't you been here these last few weeks?",
	"INFO_FILLER449":"Xardas is the leader of the orcs! He betrayed us!",
	"INFO_FILLER469":"What else can you tell me about Xardas?",
	"INFO_FILLER470":"The first attack on Faring was already a failure when he came to us.",
	"INFO_FILLER471":"But then he took the rune magic away from the Morras.",
	"INFO_FILLER472":"Our second attack on Faring turned the castle into a slaughterhouse!",
	"INFO_FILLER478":"Even here, I can feel his power. Although he is far away.",
	"INFO_FILLER479":"And where exactly is he staying?",
	"INFO_FILLER480":"He built a tower. On the icy slopes of the eastern mountains.",
	"INFO_FILLER482":"Xardas? Let me tell you something about Xardas:",
	"INFO_FILLER483":"While he's sitting in his cozy tower in Nordmar, warming his butt by the fireplace, ...",
	"INFO_FILLER484":"... our best warriors are standing around somewhere in the desert, guarding slaves.",
	"INFO_FILLER485":"And so far, none of the artifacts he is looking for have turned up.",
	"INFO_FILLER486":"That's all I've got to say about him, Morra.",
	"INFO_FILLER487":"Tell me something about Xardas.",
	"INFO_FILLER488":"The mage knows the ways of the gods. He bears the knowledge of many lifetimes.",
	"INFO_FILLER489":"He is chosen. Chosen by Beliar to bear his power.",
	"INFO_FILLER490":"Well, actually he took the power...",
	"INFO_FILLER491":"We are looking for artifacts. At the moment, nothing else is important.",
	"INFO_FILLER492":"I am looking for Xardas.",
	"INFO_FILLER493":"You have a long journey ahead of you then. His tower is in Nordmar. Far off to the east.",
	"INFO_FILLER494":"Hey, wait.",
	"INFO_FILLER496":"Be warned. The area east of Vengard is full of orcs. Plenty of orcs!",
	"INFO_FILLER497":"So what?",
	"INFO_FILLER498":"They're not really the laid-back kind, you know...",
	"INFO_FILLER499":"They are just waiting for an opportunity to fight. If they set eyes on you, you're dog meat!",
	"INFO_FILLER500":"Is there a way to get past the orcs?",
	"INFO_FILLER501":"Forget about getting to the pass behind Vengard. You'll run into even more orcs there.",
	"INFO_FILLER502":"You could try getting through to Faring. Just keep as far away from the orcs as possible.",
	"INFO_FILLER508":"No more than everyone else does. He's in cahoots with the orcs, or so they say.",
	"INFO_FILLER509":"If you want to find out more, try their shamans.",
	"INFO_FILLER510":"The only problem is getting them to talk to a human in the first place.",
	"INFO_FILLER511":"Do you know anything about Xardas?",
	"INFO_FILLER512":"Yes. He managed to stop the war. The way he stopped the rune magic was a good idea.",
	"INFO_FILLER513":"He's a brilliant man. I am glad he's not my enemy.",
	"INFO_FILLER514":"I am looking for Xardas.",
	"INFO_FILLER515":"Hmm, the last person looking for Xardas was a paladin.",
	"INFO_FILLER516":"Take me to Xardas' tower.",
	"INFO_FILLER518":"It didn't seem like it was a friendly visit.",
	"INFO_FILLER519":"Most of all, it wasn't a long visit.",
	"INFO_FILLER520":"The path below my cabin will lead you there. You must go up into the mountains.",
	"INFO_FILLER522":"Looks like we're here.",
	"INFO_FILLER526":"Is he from Nordmar? I never heard of him.",
	"INFO_FILLER528":"Xardas? Never heard of him.",
	"INFO_FILLER530":"The tower to the north? I cannot help you with that.",
	"INFO_FILLER545":"What do you do with the junk?",
	"INFO_FILLER546":"I know ways to convert the stuff into shiny coins. And we need them.",
	"INFO_FILLER547":"Wait a moment...",
	"INFO_FILLER549":"You take what you like, just like a thief. And I like that.",
	"INFO_FILLER550":"Would you be interested in a job?",
	"INFO_FILLER551":"What sort of job?",
	"INFO_FILLER555":"I have made the golden goblets disappear.",
	"INFO_FILLER556":"I knew that would appeal to you.",
	"INFO_FILLER561":"There are a couple of golden goblets in Urkrass's warehouse. They want to use them to pay for new slaves.",
	"INFO_FILLER562":"If you see to it that they disappear, I will teach you how to pick locks.",
	"INFO_FILLER564":"Well, you can exchange the golden goblets for lots of gold coin with any merchant.",
	"INFO_FILLER565":"And if you're still looking for a job, go to Ardea.",
	"INFO_FILLER566":"Jack the tower guard collected a fat lump of gold from the rebels.",
	"INFO_FILLER567":"So, you're supporting a good cause when you bring me the stuff.",
	"INFO_FILLER568":"Where do you get your goods?",
	"INFO_FILLER569":"We have people in the cities who take care of our supplies.",
	"INFO_FILLER570":"Once you have brought us a few valuables, they will let you know who they are.",
	"INFO_FILLER595":"If you have gold or silver, bring it to me.",
	"INFO_FILLER596":"I'll give you a good price for it.",
	"INFO_FILLER606":"What is there to be had in Geldern?",
	"INFO_FILLER607":"I haven't been there in a long time.",
	"INFO_FILLER609":"But there's bound to be a couple of fine artifacts lying around.",
	"INFO_FILLER625":"Welcome to Geldern, stranger. What can I do for you?",
	"INFO_FILLER626":"You're a merchant?",
	"INFO_FILLER627":"Exactly. I deal mainly in artifacts. So, if you find any, bring them to me.",
	"INFO_FILLER628":"What do you know about artifacts in this town?",
	"INFO_FILLER629":"There's a storeroom in the fortress on the south side of town where they have some valuable pieces.",
	"INFO_FILLER631":"Hey, it has come to my attention that the helmet of the paladin has disappeared.",
	"INFO_FILLER632":"How very perceptive of you...",
	"INFO_FILLER633":"I would pay whoever took it 2,000 gold coins to deliver it to me.",
	"INFO_FILLER636":"Here are the seven rings of the alchemists.",
	"INFO_FILLER637":"Finally - I'm back in business!",
	"INFO_FILLER638":"Where else are there items to be had?",
	"INFO_FILLER641":"Hi, I'm Dudley.",
	"INFO_FILLER642":"I take care of provisions and supplies.",
	"INFO_FILLER643":"How is the supply coming?",
	"INFO_FILLER644":"We need valuables. Goblets, plates, no matter what.",
	"INFO_FILLER645":"I see. You're dealing with hot goods.",
	"INFO_FILLER646":"Well, perhaps one could call it that.",
	"INFO_FILLER649":"Tell me about this region.",
	"INFO_FILLER650":"This used to be called the granary of the country.",
	"INFO_FILLER651":"And the farmers knew how to hold on to their riches.",
	"INFO_FILLER656":"Do you know where I can find some artifacts?",
	"INFO_FILLER657":"Have a look around the temple in Trelis.",
	"INFO_FILLER658":"The say that Kamak the shaman is carrying some amulet that enhances his magical powers.",
	"INFO_FILLER659":"That should be worth a bunch.",
	"INFO_FILLER660":"So you robbed the farmer Farmon.",
	"INFO_FILLER661":"Did I? Well, it won't ruin him.",
	"INFO_FILLER662":"You are completely without a conscience. I like that.",
	"INFO_FILLER666":"I cleaned out the castle of Trelis.",
	"INFO_FILLER667":"I bet the orcs aren't going to like that. Ha ha ha.",
	"INFO_FILLER668":"If you want, I'll show you a couple of tricks now.",
	"INFO_FILLER673":"Where can I get something really valuable?",
	"INFO_FILLER674":"The shaman Kamak at the excavation in Trelis carries an artifact.",
	"INFO_FILLER675":"It must be some sort of power source. Well, can't hurt for him to lose it, I guess.",
	"INFO_FILLER676":"Where is the best place to get rid of hot property?",
	"INFO_FILLER677":"West of here in Nemora is Dudley. He'll buy your stolen goods.",
	"INFO_FILLER684":"Greetings, traveler. Welcome to Varant, the great desert.",
	"INFO_FILLER685":"You must be thirsty.",
	"INFO_FILLER686":"Wanderer, wait, do not pass me by! You might be missing out on your luck!",
	"INFO_FILLER712":"Here, have a sip of cool water.",
	"INFO_FILLER715":"I've come to collect your tribute.",
	"INFO_FILLER716":"I would pay, Son of Forbearance, but I am afraid that mere gold will not suffice.",
	"INFO_FILLER717":"I promised Zuben my chalice - the chalice of the water vendors.",
	"INFO_FILLER725":"Where could the chalice be?",
	"INFO_FILLER726":"The nomads have it! Their hideouts are nearby, within the fields of ruins.",
	"INFO_FILLER735":"You aren't from here.",
	"INFO_FILLER737":"What sort of secrets?",
	"INFO_FILLER738":"We Black Mages command magic spells of great power!",
	"INFO_FILLER739":"We command the gift of the ancient, divine magic.",
	"INFO_FILLER740":"Ah, magic spells.",
	"INFO_FILLER741":"And in the city of Ishtar the art of two-handed fighting has been taught for many years.",
	"INFO_FILLER742":"But only a man who makes good deals is worthy of learning our secrets.",
	"INFO_FILLER745":"What's up?",
	"INFO_FILLER746":"I am offering you the opportunity for a good deal and you ask what is it?",
	"INFO_FILLER747":"All I want to hear from you is that you're in!",
	"INFO_FILLER748":"Sure, I'm in.",
	"INFO_FILLER749":"Then listen! These men here owe tribute to Zuben.",
	"INFO_FILLER750":"It's not as though they do not want to pay, but they managed to have it taken from them.",
	"INFO_FILLER751":"What happened?",
	"INFO_FILLER752":"Tufail, that Son of a Fool, let himself be robbed by a handful of nomads!",
	"INFO_FILLER762":"I have the chalice of the water vendors.",
	"INFO_FILLER763":"Ah, this chalice is worth a special token of my gratitude.",
	"INFO_FILLER764":"I'll pay the tribute for Luca.",
	"INFO_FILLER765":"I hope you at least made a good deal with him.",
	"INFO_FILLER768":"Here is the tribute from Bernardo.",
	"INFO_FILLER771":"He didn't give you any trouble, did he?",
	"INFO_FILLER772":"Here is the tribute from Jose.",
	"INFO_FILLER773":"I don't suppose he caused you any trouble. He is a good merchant.",
	"INFO_FILLER774":"I will bring Aila back.",
	"INFO_FILLER778":"Welcome, traveller.",
	"INFO_FILLER779":"I hope you leave some of your luck with us.",
	"INFO_FILLER780":"I have come to collect your tribute.",
	"INFO_FILLER781":"Of course I will pay. Give my compliments to Nafalem.",
	"INFO_FILLER782":"What do you know about Aila?",
	"INFO_FILLER783":"Aila! She was the flower of Braga.",
	"INFO_FILLER784":"What happened?",
	"INFO_FILLER785":"It was a raid - Asaru and his tribe simply ... stole her away!",
	"INFO_FILLER786":"Wait!",
	"INFO_FILLER787":"What do you want?",
	"INFO_FILLER788":"I want to make you an offer. You freed Aila. I will give you five hundred gold coins for her.",
	"INFO_FILLER789":"She is free, what else do you want?",
	"INFO_FILLER790":"Fine. Give me the gold.",
	"INFO_FILLER791":"No, I take her back myself.",
	"INFO_FILLER792":"I have done away with Asaru.",
	"INFO_FILLER793":"Very good. We live in the shadow of your greatness, Father of Hunting.",
	"INFO_FILLER795":"Of course I will reward you for your efforts.",
	"INFO_FILLER796":"I've come to get your tribute.",
	"INFO_FILLER797":"So? Tufail also said that some time ago. And I trusted him with my gold.",
	"INFO_FILLER798":"And what did he do? He let a handful of nomads take it away from him.",
	"INFO_FILLER799":"Does that mean you don't want to pay?",
	"INFO_FILLER800":"That's the way it is, stranger. I already paid and I won't pay another coin.",
	"INFO_FILLER801":"How about it? Will you pay now?",
	"INFO_FILLER802":"You leave me no choice, Father of Heavy Blows.",
	"INFO_FILLER803":"You're in business with the nomads.",
	"INFO_FILLER804":"That should interest Nafalem.",
	"INFO_FILLER805":"Wait, wait, Son of Cunning.",
	"INFO_FILLER806":"That can stay between us. No need to tell anyone else.",
	"INFO_FILLER807":"That depends. What is my silence worth to you?",
	"INFO_FILLER808":"I will pay you five hundred gold pieces!",
	"INFO_FILLER809":"(Sell Bernado's letter)",
	"INFO_FILLER810":"Good, give me the gold and we'll forget the whole thing.",
	"INFO_FILLER812":"I have come to demand your tribute.",
	"INFO_FILLER813":"Looks like you've come in vain, then. I haven't got a single coin.",
	"INFO_FILLER814":"That's not my problem.",
	"INFO_FILLER815":"Wait - let me propose you a deal.",
	"INFO_FILLER816":"Like what?",
	"INFO_FILLER817":"Bring me some dark leather and I can make some armor for you.",
	"INFO_FILLER818":"And in exchange, you want me to pay the tribute for you?",
	"INFO_FILLER819":"I don't owe Zuben all that much - only five hundred gold coins.",
	"INFO_FILLER820":"I suppose I have no choice. Alright, I agree.",
	"INFO_FILLER821":"Thank you, Son of Judiciousness. You've struck a good bargain.",
	"INFO_FILLER822":"What if I don't accept this?",
	"INFO_FILLER823":"Break all my bones if you want - I haven't got any gold.",
	"INFO_FILLER827":"I have done away with Taklar.",
	"INFO_FILLER828":"You have earned the bounty, then.",
	"INFO_FILLER829":"We're going back to Braga.",
	"INFO_FILLER830":"I will follow you, master.",
	"INFO_FILLER834":"I am Jose, the slave trader. If you're interested in work, I've got something for you.",
	"INFO_FILLER844":"What do you have to offer me?",
	"INFO_FILLER845":"The nomads keep attacking us.",
	"INFO_FILLER846":"Several tribes are wreaking havoc around here.",
	"INFO_FILLER847":"I will pay you a hefty bounty for each tribe leader that you kill.",
	"INFO_FILLER850":"I took care of Malir.",
	"INFO_FILLER851":"You are keeping dangerous company, traveler.",
	"INFO_FILLER852":"Take this gold as a reward for your deed.",
	"INFO_FILLER853":"I bow to your bravery, Son of Peril.",
	"INFO_FILLER854":"Wouldn't be the first time.",
	"INFO_FILLER855":"There are only two reasons why you should be here.",
	"INFO_FILLER856":"Oh really?",
	"INFO_FILLER857":"Either you want my head, or you intend to join us.",
	"INFO_FILLER858":"What exactly do you mean by 'join'?",
	"INFO_FILLER859":"We need someone who has access to the cities.",
	"INFO_FILLER860":"With your help, we could prepare for battle against the Hashishin.",
	"INFO_FILLER861":"Then we will free Braga.",
	"INFO_FILLER862":"What am I supposed to do?",
	"INFO_FILLER863":"Bring Aila back to Braga.",
	"INFO_FILLER864":"Nafalem must be pining away for her already.",
	"INFO_FILLER865":"This will make him careless - he is going to think that we are dead.",
	"INFO_FILLER866":"I have come to collect the bounty that is on your head.",
	"INFO_FILLER867":"Then draw your weapon and fight me!",
	"INFO_FILLER868":"Get out of here!",
	"INFO_FILLER869":"All right, let us cooperate.",
	"INFO_FILLER870":"A wise decision.",
	"INFO_FILLER871":"Listen, then - the clans of the nomads have left the path of tranquility.",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118154809_1":"Is that all?",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118155830":"Which men are on your list?",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118155934":"The three merchants here in Braga. Each of them owes Zuben five hundred gold coins.",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118155934_0":"And Abbas, the water vendor. I am expecting a chalice from him. Talk to him - he knows exactly what I want.",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118155934_1":"And Tufail, what shall we do with Tufail, hmm...",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118155934_2":"It is his fault the tribute was stolen.",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118160129":"About the tribute...",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118160151":"Yes, I am reasonably satisfied. I suppose there's nothing more to be had here.",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118162903":"Aila, the pearl of the city, has been abducted. I want her back!",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118163528":"Do you have anything else that needs to be done?",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118163528_0":"Discuss the details with Jose.",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118164920":"I want to offer you such a deal. What do you say?",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118181103":"But, of course, you no longer have it.",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118181103_0":"I gave it to Tufail when he collected the tribute.",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118181103_1":"But that Son of a Jinx allowed them to take it from him!",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118181103_2":"I humbly beg of you, find the chalice and bring it to Nafalem!",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118181428":"I found the chalice.",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118181443":"Then take it to Nafalem, I beg you!",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118183453":"Here's the leather.",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118183453_0":"I found some more armor in the camp.",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118183453_1":"You can have it. May it protect you well at all times!",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118183649":"Do you have anything to sell?",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118183649_0":"I am inconsolable, but I cannot offer you any armor.",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118183649_1":"All the hunters who worked for me are dead.",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118183649_2":"They were caught in a nomad ambush...",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118184020":"I guess I'll have to beat the tribute out of you.",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118185403":"What are you doing here in Braga?",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118185403_0":"I was going to hunt for a while.",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118185403_1":"Luca says they have some dark snappers here.",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118185403_2":"Their leather is suitable for the manufacture of armor.",
	"INFO_FILLER20060118185508":"Let's go hunting.",

	"INFO_FILLER20060323200727":"What have you done to Achmed? The man's completely worn out!",

	"INFO_FILLER20060323200727_1":"Well, yes, you've got a point there.",
	"INFO_FILLER20060323201143":"Fine. Now bring on this savage fellow and then I'll be champion, right?",

	"INFO_FILLER20060428022842_3":"So what? That won't help you at all. Write it down if you like - he left the city long ago anyway!",
	"INFO_FILLER20060428022842_4":"And don't think you'll learn his name from me, Son of Simplicity!",
	"INFO_FILLER20060428024716":"So, first I take you to Ramirez, and then you will accompany me to Murat's oasis.",
	"INFO_FILLER20060428024754":"Hmm, all right. Take me to Ramirez.",
	"INFO_FILLER20060428024754_0":"Then follow me, Father of Delights.",

	"INFO_SKALVERAM3104":"He's probably still somewhere near the city.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3105":"Hey, you, come here!",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3106":"My goods still haven't arrived.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3107":"What is it you mercenaries actually do all day?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3108":"But...",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3109":"Silence! I want you to bring my goods back to me.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3111":"I think this stuff belongs to you.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3112":"Well then, give it here. Good. What else do you want? Go on, beat it!",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3113":"What about my reward?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3114":"Reward? Alright. Here, take this gold. And now - beat it!",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3116":"Three large packages with my name on them! Big, sturdy wooden crates.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3123":"Sure! You can run a few errands for me right away.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3125":"It's been rather quiet lately here in Cape Dun, but it can't hurt to be prepared.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3130":"Here are 3 healing potions.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3133":"Ah, thank you. That's enough for now. If you need equipment, you know where to find me.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3137":"Where can I find Deckard the quartermaster?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3138":"Go towards the lighthouse. We have a small hut behind Urkrass's large warehouse.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3139":"Our quartermaster keeps an eye on our stuff there.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3147":"Tell me, where can I find healing plants around here?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3148":"Well, if you go further up the mountain you might get lucky.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3149":"Just make sure that you don't end up as a feast for the wolves.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3174":"The underground rebellion in the city is destroyed.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3175":"Hah! I knew those good-for-nothing mercenaries were useless.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3176":"Nothing happens for weeks, then you show up and solve the problem.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3177":"Good work. The shamans will be pleased with you.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3179":"I'm supposed to get a reward here.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3180":"You wiped out the rebel underground here in the city. That's good.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3181":"Here, you earned this.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3182":"Go to the warehouse keeper Urkrass. He will give you a reward.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3184":"Here, have some gold.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3185":"I have come to your country to offer the orcs my services as a slave hunter.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3186":"My name is Wenzel. I am a paladin and come from Montera.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3213":"And a few healing potions as well.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3216":"I would turn right around and get out of here if I were you.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3218":"There's nothing going here, man. No gold, no women, and we're out of booze more often than not.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3239":"So, you're the Morra who served the city so well.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3240":"My warriors are talking about you.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3241":"Nothing bad, I hope.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3242":"They respect you. That's enough for me.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3249":"Ah. You aren't an orc. How did you get in here?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3250":"Where can I find rebels, besides in Reddock?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3251":"They are everywhere. Throughout the land, there are groups opposing the orcs.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3252":"They hide in the woods, in caves, or in the cliffs.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3253":"The orcs will never find them all.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3254":"We will only rest when our kingdom is once again free.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3278":"One morning, shortly before dawn, the orcs surrounded the city.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3279":"And that was that. Almost half of us were killed, all the rest were enslaved.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3285":"I even captured a paladin and I question him every day.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3286":"Do you always whine like that?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3287":"Give me a bottle of booze, and the two of us will be the best of friends.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3288":"Here, I've got a bottle of booze for you.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3289":"Thanks, man! That hits the spot.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3295":"What's the matter? Haven't you ever seen anyone shoveling pig manure before?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3306":"I talked to Wenzel.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3310":"How exactly does this revolution work?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3311":"As soon as you start fighting the orcs, we will know that the time has come.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3316":"How can I support you?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3318":"So, who should I kill?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3319":"No, you should get us weapons. Nothing special, just three bundles of weapons.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3324":"I have your three bundles of weapons here.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3325":"Ah, good. That's great. Thanks.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3326":"You belong to the rebel underground.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3327":"Rebels! I hate that word.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3328":"We are simple citizens, trying not to be subjugated in our own country.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3334":"When will the revolution begin?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3335":"We won't manage it alone. The orcs outnumber us.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3336":"A very powerful paladin named Wenzel is being held prisoner up in the lighthouse.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3337":"With his support, I would take the risk of attacking the orcs here in Cape Dun.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3357":"Why are you a prisoner and not a slave?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3358":"One of their slave hunters dragged me here and sold me to the orcs.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3359":"Since then, the orcs have come every day and interrogated me.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3360":"Why?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3365":"Behave yourself in this city, newcomer.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3366":"Cape Dun is now free. And so are you.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3367":"Thank you. Without your help, they certainly would have killed me.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3369":"Every city we reconquer will empower the king.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3371":"And one more thing - if you ever go to Montera, look for a wolf cave south of the city.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3372":"There you will find a sword. It has never let me down.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3373":"I hid it there before Gamal took me prisoner.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3374":"If you bring it back to me, you won't regret it.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3387":"Not interested.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3389":"Where are you trying to go?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3390":"Just get me past the village, to Jens the hunter.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3391":"I will hide with him for a while and have a couple of decent meals.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3410":"You had better get used to it, or you won't get far with us.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3411":"You sold a paladin to the orcs?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3412":"He's up in the lighthouse, the orcs are interrogating him.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3414":"Do you still have the stuff from the captured paladin?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3415":"Yeah, a bunch of useless junk and a strange chalice.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3416":"Can I have the chalice?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3417":"100 gold coins.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3418":"Sell me the captured paladin's chalice.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3419":"Here. I can't do anything with it anyway.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3421":"I have your sword.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3422":"Really? Let me see.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3423":"Thank you, friend. Let me reward your service.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3424":"Oho, a new face.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3425":"I'm a mercenary. My name is Silas.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3434":"... another poor devil just trying to get by.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3435":"I know what it's like, it's the same with all of us.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3503":"Fine. I will send you an easy opponent first.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3504":"If you manage to defeat him, we can talk again.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3505":"What am I supposed to do?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3506":"Enter the arena and fight. If you leave, you lose.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3507":"You won.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3508":"I can send you a good opponent if you want.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3509":"But this was an easy opponent. So don't get too cocky now.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3510":"Give me an opponent.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3511":"You want to fight? You can fight.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3512":"You are going to face my best fighter.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3513":"Enter the arena.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3514":"I have won!",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3515":"Yes. You fought well.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3516":"Nobody else wants to go up against you. You are the champion.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3517":"Do I get a prize?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3518":"Yes, this sword. Wear it with pride, for it is a good blade.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3522":"If you don't, leave me alone.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3523":"What can I win in the arena?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3524":"The arena champion receives a sword.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3525":"Losers get nothing at all.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3535":"I just came from there.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3536":"Really? I never saw you arrive.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3537":"Oh well, I was probably on my way somewhere at the time.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3538":"Probably.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3542":"What village?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3543":"So you lost your way after all.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3544":"If you keep following the path to the coast, you'll get to Cape Dun.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3545":"And what will I find there?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3546":"Same thing you find everywhere these days. Orcs and mercenaries.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3547":"I'm headed for the village.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3548":"Looking for work, are you?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3549":"Depends on the work.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3550":"The mercenaries in the village are bound to need more people, provided you know how to wield a weapon.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3552":"Who is Bufford?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3553":"He's the boss here, at least of us mercenaries.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3554":"So, if you aren't exactly an orc and belong to Uruk, he's your only chance to get a foot in the door here.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3557":"I have to watch these slaves.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3558":"One of them ran off not too long ago.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3559":"Since then, we can't leave the slaves unguarded for a moment.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3560":"You'll find him at the end of the main street. He's usually standing outside his hut.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3561":"What's in the city?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3562":"City? Cape Dun may be a lot of things, but it sure isn't a city.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3563":"There isn't even a decent bar here.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3564":"But at least there's work to be had. You'll be all right.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3567":"If I'm lucky, you'll get my job.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3581":"Maybe you'll find work there if you're lucky.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3582":"There aren't enough. Bring me more.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3583":"I brought you a guest.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3584":"Harek needs to lie low for a while.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3585":"All right, he can stay with me for a bit.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3586":"You wouldn't happen to carry a piece of roast meat, by any chance?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3587":"Too bad. Oh well, doesn't matter.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3588":"Guess I will have to eat the plants, then.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3589":"Here are the healing plants. We would make a great team, you and I.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3590":"How can I find plants here?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3591":"Oh, that's easy, provided you know where to look.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3592":"Like where, for instance?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3593":"On mountainsides. If you're really lucky, you can find whole fields of plants sometimes.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3594":"Report to Bufford, maybe he's got some work for you.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3602":"One of my slaves has escaped - Harek, that mangy mutt.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3604":"He's probably still in the vicinity. Someone may have seen him outside of town.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3607":"What about you? You don't look like you're the squeamish sort.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3608":"If I knew that, I would have brought him back, wouldn't I?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3609":"I can't leave here, and I need someone to go and catch him for me.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3611":"I will catch Harek for you. Where is he?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3619":"A slave hunter's life seems to have its merits.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3620":"Help me, and I might tell you more about it.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3625":"I will not hunt people.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3626":"Times have changed. Your king no longer rules here.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3628":"An Hashishin, a servant of Beliar. I come from the south, from beyond your borders.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3631":"I'm supposed to bring his goods back to Urkrass.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3633":"Do you know where I can find them?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3634":"No, but there are lots of rebels and bandits in the woods around here.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3635":"Maybe you should just go along the coast.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3636":"There must be clues around there somewhere.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3637":"What sort of goods are they?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3638":"No idea, but I suspect the usual supplies.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3639":"The whole coastal region is currently being supplied with goods from the Midlands.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3642":"We need to contact the king.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3644":"I do not know what Rhobar is planning.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3648":"The artifacts of Adanos... then it is true. And our enemies shall show us the way...",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3649":"What are you talking about?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3655":"Dammit. I'll never be able to pull this off.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3660":"Open gate!",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3663":"Well, then - here we go!",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3665":"There. I have done everything that was necessary.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3666":"Then we are ready at last.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3668":"With the staff and the scepter, we will open the portal to the unknown land.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3674":"What's your problem?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3686":"You have accomplished much.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3693":"Xardas is seeking the five artifacts of Adanos.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3694":"So that's it! The artifacts of Adanos... the power of the gods... I see...",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3695":"What do you know about them?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3706":"Tell me more about the remaining keys to the temple.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3711":"The servant of Beliar has fallen. Zuben is dead.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3712":"What mission do you have for me?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3713":"The sand hides ancient and powerful mysteries.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3714":"Some are of use to us, others should remain hidden forever.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3715":"The orcs are digging in the ruins of the Ancient Ones.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3720":"The orcs have paid for their treachery.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3721":"Zuben's time is over.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3722":"Now it is up to you to choose which power you wish to possess!",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3725":"What about YOUR power?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3726":"I, too, bear the power of the gods in me - and this power also must be taken from our world.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3727":"And how do you think we can do that?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3728":"When it is time, we will leave the world and go to the unknown land.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3740":"I have the Scepter of Varant.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3741":"Guard it well. We will need it later!",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3742":"I have the Staff of the Wanderer.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3743":"It seems somehow familiar... hmm, all right. Keep it. It will be of use to us later.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3744":"Zuben is dead.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3746":"The king is dead!",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3748":"We need five keys in order to open the temple.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3749":"I found one of them among the ruins. So four are still missing.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3751":"I know why you have come. I know what you have done.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3758":"You have exercised my vengeance on them!",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3759":"The king of Myrtana is dead!",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3760":"The power of Innos is broken, his people will despair!",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3762":"As he served me in life, so shall he serve me in death.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3763":"Innos, I have fulfilled your will!",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3765":"Without him, the rule of the Hashishins will soon be over.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3766":"The people of Myrtana are free, and the orcs have been vanquished!",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3771":"What do you want for your temple key?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3773":"And nevertheless, you can't understand my decision...",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3774":"You have destroyed the divine artifacts!",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3778":"At any rate, you have the courage to face me.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3779":"And do you have anything else to say?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3782":"So, you have made your decision. That means nothing.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3783":"Your screams will be the last thing that is ever heard of you.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3785":"So, you were too cowardly to seize the power of Beliar!",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3786":"A rash judgment for a wise man.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3787":"Do you really believe you can delay Beliar's victory?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3788":"I see you have decided for Innos.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3789":"I am the Warrior of the Fire.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3790":"I think I left you alone among the mages and paladins for too long.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3791":"You have decided in favor of Beliar! I admit, I never expected that.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3792":"But you HAVE decided. So it must be.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3793":"We all have our reasons.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3794":"And now you are here because you must bear the consequences of your decision.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3806":"What are you doing here?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3807":"We're opening the temple, Morra. And you? Where's your shovel and why aren't you digging?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3822":"You certainly took your time! Why didn't you come sooner?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3823":"I...",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3838":"And that is that! The door is open.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3852":"I will get the vase from the temple for you.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3853":"Great. Remember, it is completely covered with writing.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3854":"And if you don't deliver the vase, a bounty hunter will deliver your head to me.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3855":"Here's the key.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3856":"You know, I purchased this for a reason.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3857":"There's something in the temple that I would like to have.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3859":"An old vase. It is covered with ancient writing.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3860":"And don't be too long.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3861":"Here's your ancient vase from the temple.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3862":"You've been to the temple? You really impress me.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3878":"I propose this deal:",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3881":"Tell me more about the temple keys of Mora Sul.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3882":"Oh, yes. I don't mind if I do.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3883":"Perhaps we could make a deal.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3884":"I'm looking for the keys to the temple.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3885":"Interesting. And how can I help you?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3889":"Do you know anything about the keys?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3890":"All right, we are both businessmen, and therefore I don't want to beat around the bush.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3891":"One of the keys is in my possession.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3892":"What do you want for the key?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3893":"The orcs want the artifacts of the Ancient Ones, they're leaving no stone unturned in the desert.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3894":"They would pay any price to get into the deepest sanctuaries of the Ancient Ones.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3895":"Therefore, this key is worth a whole lot.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3910":"(Provoke)",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3931":"No excuses! We have great things planned and no time to waste on apologies!",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3932":"I will explain everything to you as best I can.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3987":"Use key.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3994":"What do you know, it works!",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3995":"Hmm, looks like some keys are still missing.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3996":"But I'll need five keys for that.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM3999":"I'm not getting any further with my search for the divine artifacts.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM31029":"Careful, don't touch!",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM31030":"Alright, I'll be careful.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM31032":"Yes, yes. Most of it is useless crap. Recipes and love letters, that sort of thing.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM31033":"Here: Oh thighs, oh juicy thighs...",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM31034":"A love letter?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM31035":"What about the artifact of the guardians of the dead?",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM31036":"Guardians of the dead, guardians of the dead ... should be under AV 37...",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM31037":"Ah, here! I quote:",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM31039":"Get to the point.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM31040":"Here it is: ...he bore his... his... eh... artifact... blessed with the power of the light and of life ...",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM31041":"Tell me about useful ancient knowledge.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM31042":"Ancient knowledge is the key to ancient magic.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM31043":"Without that knowledge, you will never be able to learn the ancient spells.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM31044":"Stone tablets, artifacts, inscriptions - useful knowledge could be hidden anywhere.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM31045":"Here, I can give you these tablets.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM31062":"Yes, I have succeeded in deciphering some magic formulas.",
	"INFO_SKALVERAM31063":"I will teach them to you if you like.",
