    "INFO_BPANKRATZ364": "Hush! Your story has not yet been written.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ365": "therefore I cannot see it.",

    "INFO_BPANKRATZ383": "When will your people finally accept that they are beaten and give up their resistance?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ385": "We will fight you to the last man.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ386": "Well, well. So you're one of those dirty rebels, too.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ387": "I ought to kill you on the spot, but I have a better assignment for you - if you can do it.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ388": "Where can I find this rebel camp?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ389": "A whole bunch of insurgents are hiding out there somewhere.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ390": "They are interfering with our deliveries to Nordmar.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ391": "Anog is the head of the rabble. Go and kill him.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ392": "The others will soon capitulate once their leader falls.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ393": "What can I do to make them see reason?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ394": "So. You are the fellow that everyone here is talking about.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ395": "You are the great warlord that everyone here is talking about.",

    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3103": "I see. So you're his advisor.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3104": "Umbrak sent me to kill the rebel Anog.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3105": "You must have really impressed him, or he wouldn't have trusted you with such a difficult task.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3106": "Where should I look for the rebels?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3107": "I cannot tell you where the rebels are hiding.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3108": "But I can tell you from what direction they have always attacked us.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3112": "Why aren't you looking for Anog yourselves?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3113": "The slave camps out there need to be guarded.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3114": "Lots of slaves mean lots of trouble.",

    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3116": "What does a runt like you want from a leader of orc armies? Speak!",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3118": "I might know something.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3119": "Hmmm, yes, this will be just right for someone of your stripe.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3121": "There is a rebel camp outside the pass to Nordmar. I want the head of its leader.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3125": "Ask my advisor, the shaman Grompel.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3126": "He will help you find them.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3128": "All right. Follow me.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3129": "Ah. And so they are still following him.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3130": "The rebels have always attacked from the woods up there.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3131": "I suppose they must be hiding up there somewhere.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3132": "I wish you luck. You'll need it.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3136": "Anog, the leader of the rebels at the pass, is dead.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3137": "That is good. Then it won't be long before the rest of the band surrenders.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3138": "You have done the orcish people a great service.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3139": "Beliar will reward you for this.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3140": "How about if YOU reward me for it?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3141": "Mmh. What do you want? Glory? Honor?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3142": "You already have too much for a Morra.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3144": "If you are interested in gold, you can have it.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3146": "And now go! I am busy.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3147": "Hey! What are you creeping around here for?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3149": "I have come to do away with you dirty rebels.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3150": "Be careful what you're asking for, kid.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3151": "Relax. I'm just having a look around.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3152": "You can't just traipse around here, young fellow.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3153": "That's dangerous.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3154": "Who is your leader?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3155": "Our man is called Anog.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3156": "And he is going to have your hide if you mess with us.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3157": "Where's your camp?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3158": "We haven't set up a camp here in front of the pass to Nordmar.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3159": "We have occupied the whole damn forest!",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3160": "And any Orc trying to get through here will come to regret it.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3161": "But if you are looking for our leader...",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3162": "His hut is further up, in the hills.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3163": "Are you the leader here?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3164": "What does it look like, kid? Of course I am.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3165": "The warlord Umbrak in Silden wants you dead.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3166": "I know. That's no big secret.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3167": "I'm just amazed that he hasn't sent anyone to kill me off yet.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3170": "You've got a lot of stuff up here.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3171": "This is all cargo belonging to the Orcs from Silden.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3173": "And so everything's stacking up here.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3174": "So far, we have intercepted every single shipment to Nordmar.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3176": "Ever thought about conquering Silden?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3177": "Thought about? We have attacked the Orcs' outposts many times.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3178": "But we do more damage to them by heading off the Orcs trying to get through to Silden.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3186": "How's the situation at the pass?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3187": "I have heard that some Orcs are trying to make it to Silden from Nordmar again.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3188": "My scouts saw a group of Orcs up on the pass.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3189": "I will be relieved if they never reached their destination.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3190": "I took this stuff here from the Orcs at the pass.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3191": "Well done, mate.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3192": "We need to keep on our toes.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3193": "The Orcs will certainly try to get through to Silden over the pass again.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3194": "I bring a delivery from Nordmar.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3195": "Very well. Although I would have preferred a legion of orcs.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3197": "I have to go to Silden.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3200": "The rebels have occupied the entire forest.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3201": "It is said that no orc has made it through the forest alive.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3203": "Do you know a safe path?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3205": "Alright. I don't have much choice, do I?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3207": "Thanks, Morra. That sure was something.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3208": "I hope I won't be sent back to Nordmar.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3209": "I have an important delivery for the city shaman Grompel.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3210": "Why don't you just go to Grompel?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3211": "I will take you to the shaman Grompel in Silden.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3212": "Show me the way to the rebels.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3213": "The rebels are also interested in your delivery.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3214": "I imagine so. Thanks to you, they didn't catch us!",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3215": "I'll gladly pay a few gold coins for that.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3217": "Oh, shut up. I need raw meat. 50 joints.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3219": "Another layabout in my kitchen.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3220": "You're the cook here?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3221": "Stop yanking my chain and get out. I'm busy.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3222": "I brought you some meat.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3223": "I need more! Get more!",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3224": "Here. Is this enough meat?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3225": "Yes. Well. It'll be enough. For now.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3226": "Here's some gold. And now get yourself out of here.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3227": "You can't imagine how much these apes can fit in their stomachs, kid.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3228": "Go get your stinking meat yourself!",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3229": "You better leave me alone before I forget myself!",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3230": "Why can't you be more relaxed?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3231": "If I don't work hard, they will chop off my head.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3232": "So help me, or get lost. Just don't stand in my way.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3234": "Didn't you hear me? Scram!",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3235": "We orcs will kill all of you.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3240": "Umbrak. He is the lord here.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3242": "Where can I find your lord?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3243": "Umbrak is in the big house.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3244": "What should I know about your lord?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3245": "Go see Grompel the shaman. He can tell you.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3247": "Mmh... you need torches, Morra?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3248": "Never mind.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3249": "You're not exactly the brightest light, are you?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3252": "Don't even think about stealing from me, understand?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3254": "Sorry. I'm just a little edgy.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3255": "What's a guy like you doing in a place like this?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3257": "What's your job in these backwater place?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3258": "It's not like there's much to do here.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3259": "I'm just hanging out with the other mercenaries, waiting for something to happen.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3260": "You're a mercenary for the orcs and you have nothing to do?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3261": "Sure I do. Recapture runaway slaves.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3262": "It's hard work trying to find someone hiding in those dense forests out there.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3264": "What do you know about this town?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3265": "Silden lies near the pass to Nordmar.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3266": "When the war started, the orcs came over the mountains from the northeast.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3267": "That's why Silden was the first town to be overrun and captured.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3269": "Since that day, there have been no more major battles here.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3270": "Who rules this city?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3271": "Umbrak. During the war, he was a great commander of the orcs.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3275": "Grompel, the city shaman, is his right hand.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3276": "Umbrak will do nothing without consulting him first.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3277": "You're not so keen on recapturing the slaves, are you?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3278": "Those poor beggars barely have a chance of surviving in the woods anyway.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3280": "Does slave hunting pay well here?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3281": "Much too well. We mercenaries almost fight each other for the privilege.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3282": "We even let some slaves loose on purpose so that we can collect their bounty later.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3283": "You mercenaries are helping slaves escape?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3284": "You never heard me say this, understand?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3285": "If the orcs get wind of this, we're dog meat.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3286": "You're not a mercenary. You are a rebel.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3287": "Curses. Me and my big mouth.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3288": "What are you going to do now?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3289": "All rebels ought to be slaughtered.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3290": "Too bad. I expected more from you.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3291": "I don't know yet.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3292": "Join us. We could really use a man like you.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3293": "I want to help you.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3294": "Finally - someone who has the courage to get things rolling.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3295": "How about weapons?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3296": "I saw a lot of them in the mill by the river.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3297": "Should be about five bundles of weapons.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3298": "So who's your leader anyway?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3299": "My brother, Anog.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3300": "He's holed up in the woods with a few of his people.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3303": "What about the runaway slaves?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3304": "The ones that haven't been torn apart by wild beasts are hiding somewhere to the north.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3305": "Somebody must take them to our refugee camp in the woods near the pass.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3306": "A fellow named Freman will take care of them there.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3307": "If we had those it would be a huge step for us.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3308": "I've got some weapons for you.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3309": "That's good. More would be even better.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3310": "I have the weapons that you need.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3311": "You're a good man. We could really use you here.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3312": "Somebody needs to go tell him that we need his help here.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3313": "Silden needs your help.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3314": "I damn well know that.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3315": "What am I to do? I cannot leave here now.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3317": "Go to my brother Inog and tell him that HE will have to see to whatever is necessary from now on.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3324": "Your brother is dead.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3325": "By Innos. Unless there is a miracle, we are all doomed to die.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3326": "When are you rebels going to strike?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3334": "Here in Silden, the orcs are in the minority.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3335": "And yet, Umbrak still rules with an iron fist.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3336": "He must have something powerful up his sleeve to make them all fear him like that.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3338": "First we need to know exactly what it is before we go ahead with the uprising.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3339": "You orcs are in the minority here. Aren't you afraid of an uprising?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3340": "No. The Morras are too afraid of torture for that.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3341": "In the last war, I had the opportunity of refining my methods.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3342": "I would be happy to show you what I mean...",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3344": "I know Umbrak's secret.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3345": "So? What is it? A powerful magic artifact?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3346": "Umbrak was an especially brutal commander during the war.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3347": "They all avoid his wrath so they won't end up like his war victims.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3348": "Umbrak must die or we will never be free.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3349": "What about you? Would you dare to kill Umbrak?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3353": "He's an orc, not a demigod.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3354": "Your brother Anog cannot help you.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3355": "Dammit. I have no idea how I will do this all by myself.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3356": "Oh well. Thanks for your help anyway.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3361": "How's the fish business?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3362": "Fine, then we will follow you stranger, as soon as you give the signal.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3363": "I heard about the rebellion. So Silden is really free?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3364": "Yes, it is.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3369": "What are you doing here?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3370": "I'm taking care of all these escaped slaves.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3371": "There's more and more of them. Soon I won't know where to put them up.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3372": "Who are these refugees?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3373": "Lately, an increasing number of slaves have fled to the woods up here from Silden.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3374": "They are desperate and have nowhere to go.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3375": "I try to help them as best I can, and find places for them to stay.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3376": "Let's talk about the gold for the escaped slaves.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3377": "We're all poor buggers up here.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3386": "Your brother Anog is dead.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3387": "Innos be with us. Everything will be even worse from now on.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3388": "I'll get you out of here.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3389": "I'll take you somewhere else.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3390": "You can't stay here.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3391": "You won't survive here for long.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3392": "I know. What else can I do?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3393": "You have no chance of surviving up here.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3394": "Do you have a better idea?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3397": "Here, I brought an escaped slave.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3398": "Very good. I will put him up.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3407": "Anything is better than being eaten by beasts here.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3408": "Alright. I thought I'd croak out here.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3409": "So I noticed.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3410": "What do you want? Can't you see that you're bothering me?",

    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3505": "Some slaves have escaped and the orcs are not amused.",

    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3520": "And now get out before the apes take notice.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3521": "Go and get me some raw meat.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3522": "Gambal, that permanently cranky old scumbag - he's your friend?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3523": "Hahaha. Yes, he is.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3524": "He's always a bit funny with strangers, but deep down he's a kind-hearted soul.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3526": "A particularly splendid day. Don't you think?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3527": "You're an Hashishin?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3528": "Correct. My name is Quadir.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3529": "And with whom do I have the pleasure to interact?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3531": "I am new here.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3532": "Indeed? Then I'm sure you also don't know how things work here, eh?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3533": "No matter. I will take care of you, my friend.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3534": "That's none of your damn business.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3535": "Why so distrustful? Do you perhaps not like the people of the desert?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3537": "I am a procurer of valuable manpower, my friend.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3538": "You're a slave hunter.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3539": "A dreadful word for such a responsible task. Don't you think?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3540": "Do you also deal with runaway slaves?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3541": "Here in Silden, the mercenaries are responsible for keeping what I bring them.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3542": "Where do you get your slaves?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3543": "Many people are hiding from the orcs in the local woods.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3544": "I look for them and 'convince' them to work for the orcs.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3546": "I want to help you hunt slaves.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3547": "Very fine, my friend.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3548": "I have just learned that a group of woodcutters is roaming about to the west.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3549": "They are strong lads.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3550": "You should grab at least one of them.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3554": "You don't have any idea what an Hashishin looks like, do you?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3555": "Not exactly. I've only heard that they've come to Silden.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3556": "Hashishin scare you?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3557": "Don't they scare you? The things you hear are terrifying.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3558": "Supposedly, they carry people off.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3563": "They say they're evil people.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3568": "How do you make a living?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3569": "I'm a woodcutter and sell wood and wild berries.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3570": "To whom?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3571": "To the fisherfolk of Silden. They come by here quite often.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3572": "But no one has come by in a few days.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3573": "I wonder what's wrong there.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3574": "Halt.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3575": "Anything else?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3576": "I've never seen anyone like you here.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3577": "You aren't an Hashishin, are you?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3578": "I could look into why the fishermen aren't coming anymore.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3579": "Would you do that for me?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3582": "He ordered them, but never picked them up.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3585": "The Orcs have doubled their guards.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3589": "I gave the package to Stan the fisherman.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3590": "Aha. Why don't the fishermen come to us anymore?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3591": "All right. I understand.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3592": "Thank you. Here, take this gold as a reward.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3593": "Then you can take this package of wild berries to Stan the fisherman at the same time.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3594": "How's it going?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3595": "Miserable.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3596": "What's wrong with you?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3597": "Fish. Fish. Nothing but fish.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3598": "I've had it up to here with those stinking things.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3599": "I have a package here for you.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3600": "Mmh, wild berries from Bozep. Marvelous!",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3601": "I haven't been to see him since the orcs doubled the watch.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3602": "My thanks to the courier. Here, take this.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3604": "Was that your hut?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3605": "No, but mine looks almost exactly the same.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3606": "The orcs did a good job.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3607": "You're a woodcutter?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3608": "My whole life.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3609": "I don't know what I would do without the woods.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3610": "You're a really strong fellow.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3611": "Yes. I can break a solid beam with my bare hands if needed.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3612": "What's in it for me if I enslave a woodcutter for you?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3613": "You won't go away empty-handed, my friend.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3614": "I have a new man for you.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3615": "Admirably done, my friend.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3616": "Here, we will share the proceeds from the new man.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3617": "I will now take you to Silden.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3618": "You weakling, you want to enslave me?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3619": "I'm going to squash you, you bastard.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3620": "You will do what I tell you.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3621": "I suppose I don't have a choice.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3622": "You will come with me to Silden.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3623": "Whatever you say.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3624": "Where are you headed?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3626": "So I see. Is that all?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3628": "Exhausting. We're fishing like mad here.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3629": "Caravans are constantly coming by and taking the smelly things away.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3630": "We can barely keep up.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3632": "I already got the point.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3633": "I want to see your leader.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3634": "Access will only be granted to those who enjoy a certain reputation in town.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3635": "Umm... would this be the upper quarter?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3636": "Why else do you think I'm standing guard here, Morra?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3641": "How can I improve my reputation in town?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3642": "That's simple. Just make yourself useful. There's enough work to do.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3643": "There's one thing we need in particular. Reinforcements!",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3644": "Reinforcements?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3645": "Look around you. There's almost nothing but humans here.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3646": "And barely an orc who isn't feeling completely overwhelmed.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3647": "What if I help you?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3648": "YOU? You're a Morra. Just like most people here.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3649": "If you want to help defend the city, you should train your fighting skills first.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3650": "What we could really use up here is a blacksmith.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3651": "Go find us a smith.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3652": "Where can I find a blacksmith for this town?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3653": "Just walk around and ask the orcs.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3654": "There must be one among them who knows a thing or two about forging.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3655": "You now have a new blacksmith. His name is Kadok.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3656": "Finally. Why did that take you so long? Here's your reward, Morra.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3657": "I'm supposed to come pick up a piece of roast meat.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3658": "Says who?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3659": "The orc guard over there.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3660": "Grrr. Here, take this.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3661": "Where are orcs needed the most?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3662": "We need some guards here within the city.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3663": "If we don't watch out, the rebels might overrun us in the end.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3664": "Got no time. I'm on guard duty.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3665": "Everything all right?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3666": "I've been standing here for days.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3667": "I'm hungry.",

    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3675": "Go to Denpok and tell him that I'll be in town from now on.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3676": "Frillock is now patrolling the city.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3677": "Well done, Morra. Here's your reward.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3678": "Did you say lurkers?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3679": "A herd of lurkers has settled on the other side of the river to the south.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3680": "Strange things have been happening here ever since they showed up.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3681": "The shoals of fish have been going crazy.",

    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3684": "The strange lurkers are history.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3685": "Very good. Well, then it's back to guard duty.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3686": "Here, for the good news.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3687": "It can't be true.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3688": "Another fisherman gone.",

    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3702": "I'm a guard. But my halberd has disappeared.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3703": "No halberd, no guard. It's as simple as that.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3704": "Here's your halberd. I found it with the fishermen.",

    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3747": "Now, at last, I can work as a blacksmith again.",

    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3752": "Since I haven't been able to work as a blacksmith, I've just been adrift, sort of.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3753": "What's wrong?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3754": "I have misplaced my beloved smith's hammer.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3755": "Would you believe it, I have no idea where I left the darned thing.",

    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3757": "Mmh. I went to see the town smithy in Silden.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3758": "And I fought a little in the arena.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3759": "I must have lost my hammer somewhere there.",

    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3781": "Here's your reward, stranger.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3782": "Nothing to do?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3783": "Usually, I hunt up in the mountains instead of hanging around here uselessly.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3785": "I just delivered some of our pelts to the warehouse keeper.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3786": "Actually, I wanted to go straight home.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3787": "What do you hunt?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3788": "Basically everything that lives here on our plains.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3789": "For that you sometimes have to be pretty fast and nimble.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3790": "If you want, I can teach you.",

    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3792": "No problem. Come with me.",

    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3795": "Show me how to hunt.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3798": "You're the boss here?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3799": "The orcs rule, friend.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3800": "My contribution to this community is a rather humble one.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3801": "How's the hunting here?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3802": "Very good. Always plenty of prey for a hunter here up north.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3803": "Snappers, mostly. They fetch a fair amount in Silden.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3804": "I want to hunt snappers.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3805": "Great idea. I think I'll come along.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3806": "Tell me when you're ready, and off we go.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3807": "Was that all of them?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3808": "Mmh... looks like it. Too bad.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3809": "Oh well. If you want to know anything else about hunting, just ask me.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3810": "The fattest snappers used to be right here.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3812": "Do you work for the orcs?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3813": "Any human with half a brain does that.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3814": "Disobeying the orcs would be suicide.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3815": "You're a coward.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3816": "You may think whatever you like.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3817": "I'm not going to meddle as long as I can live in peace up here.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3818": "That's a sensible standpoint.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3819": "It certainly is.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3820": "Even if the orcs set the prices these days.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3821": "Back then, the humans in Silden would pay a lot more.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3822": "Silden has been liberated.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3823": "Fine with me. I hope the price for skins is going to go up, then.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3824": "Thanks for the message. Here, take this, you'll need it.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3826": "Almost too good.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3827": "We're catching more this season than we can carry.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3828": "We've barely got time to deliver the pelts we bagged to Silden.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3829": "I could take your pelts to Silden.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3830": "That would be great.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3831": "Here are eight crates of pelts, all packed up for delivery.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3833": "I gave your fur crates to Givess.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3835": "Here, I've got pelts from the hunters.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3836": "All right. But there must be more.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3838": "Great. Give it here.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3840": "Here's the gold: 1500 gold coins.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3841": "Take the gold to the hunters.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3842": "But don't dawdle too long, or they will get mad.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3843": "Now give me the gold from Givess.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3844": "Here you go. 1500 gold coins.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3845": "Great. You're really useful.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3846": "An honest man, what do you know?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3847": "Here, take your share.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3848": "I haven't got the gold.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3850": "You're squandering our hard-earned gold, you scumbag?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3851": "Have you got anything left for me?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3852": "For such an honest man? But of course.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3853": "I can teach you how to hunt.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3854": "Teach me to be a hunter.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3856": "And what do YOU hunt?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3857": "Wolves. Only wolves.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3858": "The beasts may be dangerous, but their skins fetch a good price.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3859": "Let's hunt wolves.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3861": "Well then, let's see what you've got.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3862": "Well, that was quite something.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3864": "Yes. Great.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3865": "You're good, comrade.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3867": "Can you teach me anything?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3868": "Sure, if you can already hunt a little, I can teach you properly.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3870": "Follow me. I know where to find some really fine wolves.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3871": "The silver wolves are history.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3872": "Hey, you!",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3873": "You bastard, you were going to run off with our money for the pelt delivery, weren't you?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3874": "What do you know about Silden?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3875": "Silden is called the city of hunters.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3876": "Back then, lots of hunters lived in the city.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3877": "But when the Orcs came, we had to clear out of the city.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3878": "Now only a few of us live out here in the mountains.",

    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3881": "I was once a proud warrior from the highlands of Nordmar.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3882": "Why are you in the slammer?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3883": "I stole from Barrack, the arena master.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3884": "Those boys don't take kindly to stealing, you know.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3885": "Yes. I know.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3886": "How can I help you?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3887": "You can't help me, unless you have plenty of gold.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3888": "I'm worth about 300 gold coins.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3889": "You would have to buy me from Zapotek, the camp commander.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3891": "I bought your freedom.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3892": "Yeah, right. You're just kidding around.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3893": "Do I look like I would do that?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3894": "Mmh. A man of honor. I'm impressed, my friend.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3895": "I want to buy the freedom of the Nordmarian Lars.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3896": "Mmh. All right. The Nordman belongs to you.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3897": "It would be better if he disappeared from here anyway.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3898": "So far he's caused nothing but trouble here in camp.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3900": "Take me to the Nordmar pass.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3901": "You want to see my home country?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3902": "But now I'm rotting here in this prison camp.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3903": "I'll be glad to show it to you, friend. Follow me.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3904": "The pass is over there - further to the north, my friend.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3905": "I will stay in these woods here.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3906": "I left my home for a reason, after all.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3907": "Why did you leave your home country?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3908": "I went on a quest to learn archery.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3909": "Nobody at home could or would really help me with that.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3910": "You fought in the war?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3911": "Yes. I was the strongest man in my clan back then.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3912": "Can you make me stronger, too?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3913": "If I finally get to do what I came to the midlands for - yes, I could.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3914": "But first, I need to be set free.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3915": "So where are you headed next?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3916": "Well, since you asked...",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3917": "You'll be able to find me with the rebels in the woods here if you need me.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3921": "Someone has to collect the barrels and take them over there.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3922": "Take them to the mill in Silden.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3923": "That would be a job for you, don't you think?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3924": "Yes, well. Ask a stupid question...",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3925": "I'll find you some pelts.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3926": "Then go see the hunters up north.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3927": "Where should I get the fish?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3928": "From the fisherfolk down by the river.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3932": "Do you need anything?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3933": "If you find any goods ready for shipping, bring them here.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3934": "I must be ready for when the next caravan arrives.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3935": "Where can I get firewood for you?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3936": "The slaves in the prison camp supply me with wood.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3937": "They should have delivered their eight crates some time ago.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3938": "They should have about ten stacks ready for shipping now.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3939": "I've been promised eight barrels.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3940": "Is this a mill?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3941": "It used to be.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3942": "But ever since the orcs came, it's been used as a storage room.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3943": "I assemble the goods that are delivered to nearby cities by caravan.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3944": "Tell me what you want and then go away. I haven't got time.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3946": "How are the excavations going?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3947": "Have you come to mock me, Morra?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3948": "You can see for yourself just how arduous our excavations are.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3949": "Every orc in this country is looking for the divine artifacts.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3950": "We are digging up tons of garbage from the tunnels in the area.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3951": "Where are you looking for divine artifacts?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3952": "That's no secret, Morra.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3953": "We are searching through every temple of the Ancient Ones.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3954": "If you want to know exactly where those are, look at this map.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3955": "We follow every clue from old writings and legends, no matter how small.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3956": "What do you know about the divine artifacts?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3957": "So far, the significance of the divine artifacts has not revealed itself to us shamans.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3958": "The only person who seems to know more about this is Xardas himself.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3959": "Have you got anything for me to do?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3960": "Mmh. Yes, actually, there is something you could do.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3961": "We've been told that druids have made themselves at home somewhere in the area.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3966": "What exactly do you want to know about the druids?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3967": "So far, the special abilities of druids are an unsolved mystery to us.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3968": "All we know is that they dedicate themselves to the study of various animal species.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3969": "They draw their power and fighting strength from this knowledge.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3970": "We must definitely learn more about this so that we can assess their combat strength.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3972": "Where did you send your search parties?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3973": "One to the south, and another to the north.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3974": "Ballock leads the search in the north.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3975": "But it's been a while since he reported back.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3980": "I already sent out search parties to find them.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3981": "They even say that the most powerful of all druids is among them. His name is Runak.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3982": "I need to know more about the druids.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3984": "You're following Grok's orders?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3985": "Why do you want to know that?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3986": "Grok is still waiting for your answer.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3988": "Ballock told me that he is still on his mission to find the druids.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3989": "Fine. It was well past time that he sent us word.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3991": "I'm here on the orders of Grok, the highest shaman in Geldern.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3992": "I'm supposed to look for druids.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3993": "And I won't rest until I have combed the entire forest.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3994": "What does he think? That it's child's play tracking down a druid?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3995": "I'll stay here and search the area some more.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3996": "Can I help you?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3997": "I am convinced that a druid is hiding in the woods down there by the lake.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3998": "However, I suspect that a band of rangers is also there.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ3999": "I would really like to see that pig of a druid dead.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31000": "I'll kill the druid for you.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31001": "Well, who'd have imagined it? Finally someone with guts.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31005": "The druid Runak is dead.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31006": "It's about time. I've been looking for the pig for days.",

    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31008": "I've earned it.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31009": "Then try your luck, Morra.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31010": "Then take a rest from your hard work.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31012": "My name is Runak. I am a druid.",

    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31015": "Ah, it is you. The Decider.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31016": "You have come in this time when we are in need of your help.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31017": "Why do you call me the Decider?",

    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31375": "That wasn't bad at all. You fight well, Morra.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31376": "But don't forget that Kulak is still the champion.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31377": "You want me to work for you?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31378": "I would do it myself, but it is a somewhat delicate matter.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31379": "Mirzo, that big-headed louse of an Hashishin, has been mocking me for days.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31380": "Every time he gets a major shipment, he dumps his trash right in front of my arena.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31381": "He only does that to annoy me.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31382": "I would love to teach him a little lesson.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31383": "Why don't you take care of it yourself?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31384": "I thought you orcs were the rulers of this city?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31385": "Ever since we entered this alliance with the desert people, things haven't been the same.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31386": "I can't just go and smack that Hashishin around!",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31387": "But you're a Morra. It's different for you.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31388": "I'll take care of it.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31389": "Fine. Just don't kill him, or you'll be in a lot more trouble than you can afford.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31390": "I'm not your slave. Kindly go and see to it yourself.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31391": "Coward. Are you trying to tell me that you are scared of an Hashishin?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31392": "Mirzo got what he had coming.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31393": "Amazing. I never thought you had it in you, Morra.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31394": "I will pay big for this.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31395": "I'm going to punch you in the face a few times now in the name of Agenak.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31396": "Ha ha ha. Aren't you the bold one.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31397": "All right then, show me what you're made of.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31398": "Don't you blather at me, Morra.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31399": "I am the champion here. You are not worthy of my attention.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31400": "Didn't you hear me?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31401": "I said, don't blather at me!",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31402": "Alright, Morra. You're the better fighter of us two.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31403": "Are you happy, then? Go now.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31404": "I find it degrading to fight for a handful of junk.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31405": "What do you mean, junk?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31408": "In this arena you only fight for artifacts, Morra.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31409": "Nothing worthwhile, just some old stuff from times long forgotten.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31410": "Then why don't you go fight in a different arena?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31411": "Watch that big mouth, Morra.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31412": "I'd have left here long ago if I could.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31413": "So what can we do to restore your honor?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31414": "I've heard of an unholy bastard who raided one of our mines.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31415": "A renegade mercenary named Ivan. Death to all traitors!",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31416": "Ivan is dead.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31417": "Good. Then I will keep on fighting in the arena until another opportunity arises.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31418": "Strength and honor, Morra. Farewell.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31419": "There's no honor in that if you ask me.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31420": "Let's give Ivan what he deserves.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31421": "What? You? Ha!",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31422": "First you will prove that you're worthy to fight by my side, Morra.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31423": "Defeat me in the arena. Then I might think about it.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31425": "You honorably defeated me. We will fight together.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31426": "The renegade mercenary Ivan is somewhere north of Geldern.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31428": "You're a strong and proud fighter, stranger.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31429": "Have you also come to win fame and glory in the arena?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31430": "Why are YOU fighting in the arena?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31431": "Many people do this in order to improve their reputation with the orcs.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31432": "Well, at any rate, it improves their lives, if you get my drift.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31433": "Where ELSE can I find artifacts other than the wolf mine?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31434": "A lot of artifacts can be found in this part of Myrtana, around Geldern.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31435": "So far we haven't gotten around to opening up all of the areas.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31436": "In the north is an old ruin on top of a crag.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31437": "Go and see what can be had there, and bring it to me.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31438": "Here. I found this scepter in the old ruins in the north.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31439": "Mmh. Doesn't look particularly valuable. I think you can keep it.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31440": "Well done. I don't need to send anyone else to the ruins then.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31441": "Welcome to my humble business, Son of Tastefulness.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31442": "Do you seek goods from the distant desert, or are you looking for rare artifacts?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31443": "Whatever it is, you will find it here.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31444": "You sell artifacts?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31445": "What a curious question, Son of Puzzlement.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31446": "Don't you know where you are? This is Geldern.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31447": "The meeting point for every artifact hunter in the land.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31450": "Show me your goods.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31451": "I have everything you want, Son of Bargaining.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31452": "Even a successful fight in the arena is rewarded with an artifact here in Geldern.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31453": "Nowhere in Myrtana are there more artifact dealers and seekers than here.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31454": "Where do you get your artifacts?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31455": "Ha ha ha. I ask you, my friend.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31456": "What sort of a businessman would I be if I gave away my sources?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31457": "What are you doing digging around here alone?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31458": "Damn. It must be somewhere.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31463": "He is also an Hashishin and a very powerful merchant in Geldern.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31464": "He won't be happy if you bother me while I work.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31465": "Just watch out. If you touch a hair on my head, I'll tell my brother.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31466": "You're an Hashishin, right?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31468": "Yes, and? Is that so unusual?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31469": "Is your brother called Mirzo?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31470": "I see you've already had the pleasure of meeting him.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31471": "Then you also know what will happen if you bother me while I work.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31472": "You had better mind your own affairs, Son of Prying.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31475": "What are you looking for?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31476": "Artifacts, you lunatic.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31477": "You let your own brother Mazin dig up artifacts in the abandoned mine.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31478": "Uh... how in Beliar's name did you find out about that?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31479": "The poor devil is digging his hands raw out there so that YOU can make a profit here.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31480": "Pssssst. Not so loud. You don't have to let everyone know.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31481": "The orcs mustn't know that the abandoned mine to the north is productive again.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31483": "What else? Beat it.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31485": "I'll pay you a pretty sum if you keep it to yourself.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31486": "Here, take this, my friend.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31487": "You bastard, you told the orcs about the abandoned mine. Admit it.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31488": "You'll pay for this.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31489": "Interested in rare artifacts, stranger?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31490": "The abandoned mine is still productive after all.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31491": "How do you know that?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31493": "Very good work. Here is your reward. You earned it.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31494": "Mirzo is ruined. I have closed down his business.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31495": "Hahaha. That's even more than I had hoped for.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31496": "If they find out, they will reoccupy the mine.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31497": "Then I would be ruined.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31498": "Mirzo the Hashishin gets his artifacts from there.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31499": "Not any more. I'll put the mine back into operation.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31500": "Not bad. Here, take this as a reward.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31501": "Are there mines in the south of Geldern?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31502": "There is an abandoned mine. But we don't dig there any more.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31503": "It was no longer productive enough.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31504": "I've done enough in this life.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31505": "I just want to sleep.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31506": "My name is Hamil. I can offer you the best and most reasonably priced artifacts there are.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31507": "You're a trader in the slave quarter?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31508": "We all do what we can.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31509": "It is my fate to be stuck in this slave hole.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31510": "But my goods are top quality nevertheless.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31511": "Show me your stuff.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31513": "Oh, you know... here and there.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31514": "Things will fall off the back of carts sometimes.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31515": "In other words, you're stealing from the orcs.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31516": "One of the slaves is dealing in stolen artifacts.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31517": "WHO? What's his name?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31518": "Hamil.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31519": "He's just small fry.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31520": "One of the alchemists in the city is behind this.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31521": "Go and find out which alchemist Hamil is working for.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31522": "Peratur the alchemist has ordered the slave Hamil to steal artifacts.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31523": "Ah, yes. Peratur and Hamil you say? That's good to know.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31524": "I'll make the necessary arrangements to put a stop to it.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31526": "Stealing is such an ugly word.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31527": "We humans should stick together, don't you think?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31528": "You swine, you ratted me out. Now I'm back to breaking rocks.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31529": "Very soon you'll see where it gets you to be in cahoots with the orcs, scumbag!",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31530": "Do you know a slave named Hamil?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31531": "I don't know him.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31532": "Well, well.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31533": "All right. I admit I know the fellow.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31534": "He works for me.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31535": "You order a slave to steal for you?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31536": "He doesn't do it just for me.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31537": "As far as I know, he also sells the stolen stuff himself.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31538": "Aren't you afraid that the orcs will find out what you and Hamil are up to?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31539": "No. The orcs need me here.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31540": "Hamil is the only one who has anything to fear. He is expendable.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31541": "If they sent you to tell me that it should go faster...",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31543": "Never mind. I thought you were here to demand the next delivery for the orcs.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31545": "I am an alchemist. What would I make for the orcs?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31546": "Potions, of course.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31547": "Those warmongers have an inhumanly high need for healing and mana potions.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31548": "Can you sell me potions?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31549": "Not just that. I also have some rare artifacts.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31551": "Interested?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31552": "Eh. Have we met?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31553": "I wouldn't know where.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31554": "I'm an old man and I can't remember every face anymore, you know?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31557": "Eh. Yes. Eh. Pardon me?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31558": "I ASKED WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE?!",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31559": "Eh. I almost had it...",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31560": "No. I forgot.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31561": "You're an alchemist.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31562": "Yes. Exactly. That's it. Thank you, son. Now I remember. Yes. Alchemist.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31563": "Say, are you yanking my chain?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31564": "Eh... my... what? Brain?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31565": "Yes. It does get a bit addled at times.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31568": "Potions, you say? Eh. Yes. I think so.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31569": "Can I help you, old man?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31570": "Show me your potions.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31571": "Eh... it could be that I have some... take a look, son.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31572": "Certainly. Eh... what was I about to make again?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31573": "A potion.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31575": "Weeell. Let me think a moment. I think I'm Renwik, aren't I?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31576": "Yes. My name is Renwik.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31577": "Right. It was even a very powerful one.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31578": "All I'm missing is a bunch of King's Sorrel.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31579": "It's very rare. Yes, it is.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31581": "Where can I find King's Sorrel?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31582": "What would a man like you want with such a rare plant?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31583": "I thought I might bring it to you.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31584": "Really? That would be most charming, son.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31585": "I think I saw some near the abandoned mine to the south.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31586": "Although I'm not sure. Yes, that's it.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31587": "Tell me more about the abandoned mine.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31588": "Mine? What mine?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31589": "Forget it.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31591": "Eh. You look familiar. Do I know you?",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31592": "You are the alchemist Renwik, and I am the fellow who has the privilege of getting you King's Sorrel.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31593": "Right. That was it.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31594": "Here, I have your King's Sorrel.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31595": "King's Sorrel? Really? Oh, that's wonderful.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31596": "Then I can devote myself once again to my ... eh.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31597": "You can devote yourself to your potions again.",
    "INFO_BPANKRATZ31599": "Take this as thanks, son."
